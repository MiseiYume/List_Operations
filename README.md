# Simple operations on list in Python
Program with various but simple operations on a list (MList)

Program comes with three files:
    main.py - that's where the whole program should be executed from
    mlist.py - module with MList class and it's methods and variables
    test-mlist.py - sadly not working properly because of inability to install the pytest package

## General info
It's a rather small program, a bit too simple in my opinion, but does everything that's been listed in exercise scope. 

Some methods include error handling done for Value Errors and Index Error (in one of the methods).

Syntax checked with Flake8 to meet the PEP8 formatting norms.
